## 09 Darkmode/Lightmode
Surprisingly easy to implement. Since I designed the colors as theme variables from the start (secondary and third), I only needed to flip them — no hunting through components to change hardcoded colors. Added a body.light class in CSS that swaps the background and text. The toggle component uses useState to track the current theme and useEffect to sync it with the body class and localStorage (so it remembers your preference). The toggle button still needs some polishing — maybe a sun/moon icon instead of plain text.
