## 07 This Build Log
Building a blog-style section needed some planning — I didn't want one giant wall of text. Decided to use separate .md files for each entry, loaded dynamically with Vite's import.meta.glob. Each file is a standalone post, sorted by filename so the oldest entries appear first (01, 02, 03...). To keep the page clean, I added an accordion — click a title to expand its content. This uses React's useState to track which post is open. Writing in markdown keeps content easy to edit without touching React code.
