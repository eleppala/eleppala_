## 02 Project setup & Configuration
After choosing the stack, I initialized the project and wired up Tailwind CSS manually. I kept the configuration minimal and avoided unnecessary defaults. Once the setup was confirmed working, I cleaned out unused template files. I defined a minimal theme: a few colors and a base font, nothing final.
