## 08 Animated Background
For this one, I used AI to brainstorm different animated background ideas. Tested a few options — floating shapes, gradient animations, particle effects — and landed on a subtle floating blob effect. It's not perfect, but good enough for now. Will probably revisit this later when I have a clearer vision for the overall design.
