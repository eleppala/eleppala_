## 06 Routing & Pages
To make the site feel like an app (no page reloads), I added React Router. It watches the URL and swaps components accordingly — /about renders About, /build renders Build, etc. The Topbar stays visible on all pages because it's outside the Routes wrapper. Links use <Link to="/path"> instead of <a href> to prevent full page refreshes.
