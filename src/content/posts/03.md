## 03 Git workflow
Since I'm working solo, I simplified the typical Git Flow. The main branch is always production-ready and auto-deploys to Cloudflare. I do most of my work directly in dev, and only create feat/* branches for bigger features that might take multiple sessions or need isolation. When dev is stable, I merge it to main and push — that's it. No pull requests, no code reviews, just a clean separation between "work in progress" and "live site."
