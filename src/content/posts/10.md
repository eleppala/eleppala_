## 10 Contact Form 
- I consulted AI on how to implement it, and Claude suggested using Mailchannels with Cloudflare. I went down that path and spent time configuring everything, only to discover that Mailchannels requires a paid plan. Frustrated, I found Resend as an alternative and had to start over: sign up, generate an API key, configure Cloudflare secrets again, and rewrite the backend code. It was inefficient and took longer than it should have, but the form is finally working now.
- **The Backend Part**: The contact.ts file acts as a backend — it's a server-side function that runs on Cloudflare's servers. When the form is submitted from the frontend, it sends data to this function, which validates the input, retrieves the API key from Cloudflare secrets, and makes the actual request to Resend to send the email. This keeps sensitive information like API keys safe on the server instead of exposing them in the browser.
