## 05 Components
React apps are built from components — reusable pieces of UI that you can compose together. Instead of one giant HTML file, you break the interface into smaller parts like Topbar, Home, About. Each component is a function that returns JSX (HTML-like syntax in JavaScript). This makes code easier to organize, reuse, and maintain.
