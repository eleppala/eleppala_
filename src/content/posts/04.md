## 04 Cloudflare
I already owned the domain eleppala.com, so deployment was straightforward. Created a new Pages project in Cloudflare, connected it to the GitHub repo, and configured the build settings (npm run build, output directory dist). After the first deploy, I added my custom domain in the Pages settings. Now every push to main triggers an automatic build and deploy.
