        Hive gave me a strong foundation in learning how to learn — breaking down problems, picking up new languages, 
        and adapting quickly to new technologies.

        Outside of tech, I enjoy sports, especially tennis, golf, and ice hockey.

        **Core programming**
        C, C++, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript

        **Frontend**
        React, Vue, Nuxt, TailwindCSS

        **Systems & tooling**
        Git, Docker, Shell, Shell scripting, Makefiles, Unix/Linux environments

        **Computer science fundamentals**
        Algorithms & data structures, memory management, basics of networking, basics of virtualization

        **Databases**
        SQL (basics)

        I’m comfortable work between low-level and high-level development and continuously expanding my skill set.`

        content: `AI is everywhere today, and I was recently asked to work on a project that uses Lovable AI. \
        I tested the tool and found it to be highly user-friendly and fast. The main limitation was my lack of \
        familiarity with the underlying technology stack. So I decided to build this website using the same tech \
        stack — React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind — to learn modern web development by doing.

        Along the way, I bought a domain through Cloudflare, figured out how to publish the site, and configured everything \
        from deployments to email. I also set up a contact form with redirections to my own email.

        AI helped a lot as a teacher and productivity boost, but I’m intentionally avoiding blind copy-pasting and focusing \
        on understanding how things work.

        This site is still a work in progress, and I’m actively learning.
        That’s part of the journey.`

        My projects work and have solid code, but many aren’t great showcase pieces — most are written in C and rely on \
        dependencies that don’t run smoothly on every machine (especially Windows).

        I also realized that relying only on old GitHub projects isn’t enough anymore. I needed to build something new — \
        and that’s how the idea for this website came to life. I’ll share more about it in a separate “This Website” post. `

        We set a personal deadline for ourselves, and the last stint involved about 30 hours straight of coding, testing, \
        and fixing. In the end, we succeeded — delivering a functional project on time and achieving our goal. \
        It was an intense but incredibly rewarding experience.
